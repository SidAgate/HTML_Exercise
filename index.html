      <h1>Sid Pranke</h1>
        <p>Once I read about describing yourself as a type of ice cream. Well, I like choices <strong>and</strong> quality
        ingredients both in my food and in my lifestyle so I'm going to say I'm organic butter brickle swirl ice cream with 
        chocolate chunks. I started off as a writer, branched off into video, then digital marketing and now web developer. 
        Some of my likes and dislikes: I like flowers but I hate bugs. I like canoeing and using my rowing machine for workouts. 
        I don't like artichokes, beets or eggplant and I don't eat beef or pork. I love spaghetti made with ground turkey for 
        the sauce, delicious!

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong>isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
